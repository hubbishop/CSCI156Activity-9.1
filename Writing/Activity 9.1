Writing/Reading from a file part 1

1. Write a while loop that only exits when a user enters q (or Q). Otherwise write the users input to a file user.txt.

2. Rewrite your loop to count how many lines the use inputs. Use the count to print out the contents of the file – the count 
will tell you how many readlines() you need.
